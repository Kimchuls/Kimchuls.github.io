My name is **Chenzhe Jin**, and I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at **Purdue University**, where I am advised by Professor **Jianguo Wang**[](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/csjgwang/). My research focuses on the optimization and implementation of vector databases, as well as the design of multimodal database systems. These areas combine my passion for cutting-edge database technologies and my curiosity about efficient data management.

In my academic journey, I have dedicated myself to advancing the efficiency and scalability of vector data retrieval systems. My work involves exploring innovative data structures and optimization techniques to tackle the challenges posed by massive datasets. Additionally, I am engaged in the development of multimodal database systems, which aim to seamlessly integrate and manage diverse data types, including text, JSON, and vector data.

My contributions to this field include multiple publications in renowned venues, such as VLDB. Notably, I co-authored a study on SingleStore-V, a cutting-edge vector database system designed for both OLAP and OLTP workloads, which demonstrates my commitment to bridging the gap between academic innovation and industrial applications.

Outside of research, I have honed my technical expertise through internships at leading companies like SingleStore and ByteDance. These experiences have enriched my understanding of real-world applications and further motivated my pursuit of impactful research.
